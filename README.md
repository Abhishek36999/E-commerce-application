# E-commerce-application
My first project console based e-commerce application using java OOP.
How the Code Works:
Product Class:
   - Holds details about individual products, like id, name, price, and quantity.
   - Includes methods to get and set these values, and a displayProduct() method to print product details.

Cart Class:
   - Manages the items added to the cart.
   - Allows adding products, removing them, viewing the cart, and checking out.
   - Maintains the total amount of the cart and handles user actions related to the cart.

ShoppingApp Class:
   - Contains the main logic to run the application.
   - Uses a simple console menu for interaction.
   - Allows users to view products, add them to the cart, view the cart, remove items, and checkout.
